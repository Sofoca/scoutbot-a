# WBM Flat Bot

Python bot that automates flat search and application for flats by WBM Wohnungsbaugesellschaft Berlin-Mitte.

## Features

- Search flats by zip code, flat size, minimum room number, maximum rent (more to come)
- Filter flats by net household income and net base rent ratio. WBM only considers applicants with net household income between 15% and 30% of the net base rent: https://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/SharedDocs/praxisbeispiele/DE/wohnungsmarkt/praxisbeispiel-wbm.html
- Filter by WBS requirement (apply only to flats that require a WBS, or only to those that don't)
- Apply automatically via application form and log applications
- **Telegram notifications**: receive a message after WBM confirms an application, or when an application needs attention. Failure messages include the stage, listing link, and workflow logs.
- **Persistent application log**: `flats.log` is stored on a separate `log` branch. New entries contain only the deduplication hash. Application history and incident state are preserved even after a scraper failure.

It is not yet possible to search for WBS flats, but this feature will be implemented soon.

This bot tries to scrape flats responsibly by offering more filter options than preexisting WBM flat bots, without sacrificing too much speed, since speed is crucial for being considered in the WBM application process.
It does not require local installation and aims to be accessible to people with little coding experience.

## Background

Flats are posted on weekdays at https://www.wbm.de/wohnungen-berlin/angebote/. To apply for a flat, the form at the bottom of each listing page must be filled out. This is what this bot does for you. The form asks for full name and email address, and, if applicable, details about a Wohnberechtigungsschein (WBS).
Sometimes WBM sends a follow-up email shortly after the application is submitted, asking for confirmation, which has to be confirmed manually.
Once a listing is taken offline, WBM follows up via email. If the application was submitted too late, applicants receive a rejection notice. If the application was submitted fast enough, applicants receive an exposé along with a link to a more detailed form (Selbstauskunftformular). This second form must be filled out within 24 hours.
If the application meets WBM's criteria, the applicant may be invited to a flat viewing.

WBM generally aims for a 1:1 room/tenant ratio, so please set a realistic minimum room number in your search criteria. An application from a single person for a three-bedroom flat is guaranteed not to be considered.

## Usage

1. Fork this repository
2. In your forked repository, go to _Settings_ -> _Secrets and variables_ -> _Actions_ -> _Secrets_ and set up a new _Repository secret_ called `USER_CONFIG`. Paste the content of the sample config.yaml file in the window and adapt to your needs (replace email, name, search criteria).
3. _(Optional)_ **Set up Telegram notifications**: create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to get a bot token. Notifications can be sent to your personal chat or to a group chat. Add two repository secrets: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. When both secrets are present, you will receive a Telegram message every time an application is submitted.

   **Finding your chat ID:**
   - _Personal_: message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) — they reply with your chat ID instantly.
   - _Group_: add [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group, note the (negative) chat ID from its reply, then remove the bot. Alternatively, use the bot token URL method below.
   - _Via your bot's token_: send a message to your bot (or in the group), then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` in your browser and look for `"chat":{"id": ...}` in the response.

   **For group notifications**: by default Telegram bots cannot read group messages (privacy mode is on), which means the `getUpdates` method above won't return any results. To fix this, go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/setprivacy`, select your bot, and choose _Disable_. After that, send a message in the group and open the `getUpdates` URL to get the chat ID. You can re-enable privacy mode afterwards — the bot only needs to _send_ messages to the group, not read them.

4. Remove comments in front of "schedule" and "- cron: '_/5 6-19 _ \* 1-5'" in the file `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml`
5. Go to the repository's _Actions_ tab to check runs. You can trigger a run manually. Runs needing attention upload a `scraper-logs` artifact, retained for seven days. `flats.log` records confirmed applications; `app.log` records the process. Routine successful runs do not upload artifacts.
6. Don't forget to delete your fork, remove the file `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml` or comment out the "schedule" and "- cron: '_/5 6-19 _ \* 1-5'" bit when your flat search is over!

Although the workflow is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, GitHub Actions may experience server-side delays, so the actual interval is closer to 15 minutes.

## Failure handling and privacy

Temporary query failures are retried and remain quiet. Three consecutive failed runs trigger a Telegram alert; successful queries reset that counter. Application failures trigger an alert immediately after safe preparation retries. An unchanged incident is reported once until it recovers or changes. A workflow can therefore be green after an actionable failure was delivered to Telegram. If Telegram delivery also fails, the workflow fails so GitHub can send its fallback email, provided Actions email notifications are enabled for your account.

An application is recorded only after WBM displays its confirmation. If submission starts but the result cannot be confirmed, that flat is marked pending in `logs/state.json` and is not submitted again automatically. Check the WBM confirmation email. If it was received, add the flat's hash to `logs/flats.log` on the `log` branch, then remove its pending entry. If it was not sent, remove the pending entry to allow another attempt. The alert contains the listing link; its hash is the pending key in the state file. Pending entries and incident fingerprints contain no applicant details.

Each person's running repository must retain its own `USER_CONFIG`, Telegram secrets, and `log` branch. When sharing a code fix between repositories, update only the code branch. Never copy one person's log branch to another. Concurrent runs within a repository are serialized to protect deduplication state.

Standard GitHub-hosted runners in public repositories are free. Private repositories use the account's included minutes (2,000/month on GitHub Free). Artifact and cache storage have separate limits; see [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions). The workflows use standard Linux runners and upload diagnostic artifacts only when needed. The regression-test workflow uses a local test website and never sends real applications.

Public repositories expose their code, log branches, and downloadable Actions artifacts to readers. Keep applicant names, email addresses, income, and tokens in repository secrets. New application-history entries store only hashes, and new state files store incident fingerprints rather than notification text. Older log entries may still contain listing details in Git history. These changes do not erase historical data. Avoid adding full HTML dumps or screenshots containing filled forms to public artifacts.

## Reliable Triggering via Cloudflare Worker (optional)

GitHub's scheduled Actions are known to be delayed, sometimes by 10–30 minutes or more. A more reliable alternative is to trigger the workflow externally using a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), which is free for up to 100,000 requests/day and has a cron scheduler that fires on time. The worker sends a `workflow_dispatch` event to the GitHub Actions API, which triggers the scraper immediately.

**Setup:**

1. Create a free Cloudflare account and a new Worker at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Paste the following worker script:

```js
// Trigger a single GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
async function triggerWorkflow(workflow, env) {
  const res = await fetch(
    `https://api.github.com/repos/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>/actions/workflows/${workflow}/dispatches`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `token ${env.GITHUB_PAT}`,
        Accept: "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "User-Agent": "scoutbot-trigger-worker",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ ref: "main" }),
    },
  );
  console.log(`Triggered ${workflow}: ${res.status}`);
  return { workflow, status: res.status };
}

// Add random jitter 0-45s to avoid always hitting at the exact same second
async function triggerWithJitter(workflow, env) {
  const jitterSec = Math.floor(Math.random() * 46);
  await scheduler.wait(jitterSec * 1000);
  return triggerWorkflow(workflow, env);
}

export default {
  async scheduled(event, env, ctx) {
    ctx.waitUntil(triggerWithJitter("run-scraper.yml", env));
  },
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    ctx.waitUntil(triggerWithJitter("run-scraper.yml", env));
    return new Response(
      "Triggered! run-scraper.yml will fire after random 0-45s jitter.",
    );
  },
};
```

3. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_REPO>` with your fork's details.
4. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `repo` scope (or `actions:write` with fine-grained tokens). Add it as a Worker secret named `GITHUB_PAT` under _Settings_ -> _Variables and secrets_ in the Worker dashboard.
5. Under _Triggers_ -> _Cron_, add a cron expression. `2/3 * * * *` fires every 3 minutes starting at 2 minutes past each hour, which gives a comfortable overlap with the GitHub schedule without hammering the API.
6. Make sure the `schedule` trigger in `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml` remains commented out — the Worker replaces it. The `workflow_dispatch` trigger must stay enabled (it already is by default).

_Your email address, full name and household net income will be sent to GitHub servers if you use this bot. However, since your data is stored in a repository secret, it is encrypted before it reaches GitHub (see [GitHub documentation pages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/secrets) for more information). Since the rent levels of flats applied for could allow inferences about your net household income, this information is removed from the flat applications log file, which is public if the repository is public._

## Detailed Usage Instructions

If you are new to coding and GitHub, you may find the following more detailed instructions helpful.

**1. Fork this repository**

To fork the repository, click on the _Fork_ button at the top right of the repository main page:

![Fork Repo](images/demo_forking.png)

This opens a new window. **Make sure to uncheck the "Copy the `main` branch only" option** before clicking "Create Fork". This is important because the bot uses a separate `log` branch to persist the application log across runs — if that branch is missing from your fork, the workflow will fail on the very first run.

**2. In your forked repository, go to _Settings_ -> _Secrets and variables_ -> _Actions_ -> _Secrets_ and set up a new _Repository secret_ called `USER_CONFIG`.**

![Open Settings](images/demo_settings.png)

![Open Actions Secrets](images/demo_secrets.png)

**Paste the content of the sample config.yaml file in the window and adapt to your needs (replace email, name, search criteria).**

![Create Repository Secret](images/demo_config.png)

Make sure you follow the format of the file exactly, i.e. include spaces where the sample config file had spaces, use the same symbols and don't change indentation.
`loc_filter` is meant for zip codes and prefixes of zip codes for areas you would like to restrict your flat search to.
`kw_filter` is meant for other search criteria. Keywords can be any of the following:

- Bad mit Wanne
- Bad mit Fenster
- Aufzug
- Offene Küche
- Balkon
- Barrierearm
- (more will be added soon).

You can use any keywords that are commonly featured on the WBM flat listing page https://www.wbm.de/wohnungen-berlin/angebote/.

**3. Remove comments in front of "schedule" and "- cron: '_/5 6-19 _ \* 1-5'" in the file `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml`**

To edit this file, first open the file by navigating from the main page of the repository to `.github` -> `workflows` -> `run_scraper.yml`.

![Uncomment Schedule](images/demo_comment.png)
![Uncomment Schedule](images/demo_commit.png)

Make sure you just remove the `#` symbols, do not change anything else.

After making your changes, click on the "Commit changes..." button in the top right corner. This opens a new window. Again, you do not need to change anything here, just confirm with "Commit changes".
